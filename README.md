# Adaptive Moment Indicator

## Overview

The Adaptive Moment Indicator is a custom technical analysis tool designed for financial markets. This project implements the indicator in Python, providing a flexible and powerful way to analyze market momentum and potential trend changes.

## Disclaimer

This indicator is still in work, the output may be bad because the idea is still being examined. I was inspired by the ADAM optimizer in neural networks, so my idea here was to find the minimum of the price or just use the prices(like gradients) with their slope to see where the price is heading.

## Features

- Calculates the Adaptive Moment Indicator for given price data
- Adjusts sensitivity based on market volatility
- Provides insights into market momentum

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YoussefBechara/Adaptive-Moment-Indicator.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Adaptive-Moment-Indicator
sql_more


3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

The main functionality is contained in `main.py`. To use the Adaptive Moment Indicator:

1. Open `main.py` in your preferred Python environment.
2. Modify the input data or parameters as needed.
3. Run the script:

python main.py
sql_more


## How It Works

The Adaptive Moment Indicator likely uses a combination of price data and volatility measures to create a momentum indicator that adapts to changing market conditions. The exact algorithm and calculations are implemented in the `main.py` file.

## Customization

You can customize the indicator by modifying parameters in `main.py`. Common adjustments might include:

- Lookback period
- Smoothing factor
- Adaptation rate

Refer to the code comments for more details on available parameters and their effects.
